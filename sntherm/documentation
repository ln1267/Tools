c the model will then expect to read the following items.  This read will 
c be repeated for each layer whose type is in the user defined range of 90
c to 99.
c

c calculated or the terrain is sloped.
c
c Degrees latitude
c Degrees longitude
c Elevation angle of slope in degrees, measured from horizontal.

c   absolute north.

c LINE READ 8:  Initial node values.  One line for each node,
c  START WITH THE BOTTOM NODE AS NODE NUMBER 1.
c
c Temperature (Kelvins)
c    Comment: The model uses a freezing curve to determine what portion,
c    f1, of the nodal water content is unfrozen.  In the case of snow, 
c    it has been arbitrarily been set to begin melting near 272.83 K
c    according to the relationship
c      f1 = 1./[1. + (100.Td)^2].
c
c Node thickness (m)
c    For the top 2 nodes, thicknesses are usually initialized at 0.01 
c    and 0.02 m.  The minimum allowable thickness for any node is 0.002m
c    and the maximum allowable thicknesses for the top two nodes are 
c    respectively 0.0163 and 0.0333m.
c Bulk water density, frozen and liquid  (Kg/m^3)
c    Initial bulk water density for soil should  be between 
c    (0.75*plasticity number*bulk dry soil density) and the 
c    saturation level (density of ice * porosity)
c    For soil nodes, the plasticity number (ranging from 0.03 for sand
c    to 0.25 for clay) is (among other things) generally related to
c    grain size and minimum (irreducible) water content. 
c Grain diameter (m)

c File MET.IN
c This file contains meteorological values, usually in the form of hourly
c averages (time-step indicated in LINE READ 1).  Optionally, values may
c be generated by theoretical functions (repeated constants, sine-waves,
c etc.).

c Julian day
c Hour
c Minute
c Ambient air temperature (Kelvins)
c Relative humidity
c Windspeed (m/sec)

c    equivalent)
c Precipitation type code 1=rain  2=snow or sleet

c Optional file TC.IN
c Contains measured values of surface and snow/ground interface temper-
c atures from which to calculate an RMS error.  Data should be at the 
c basic time-step rate (usually hourly).  each line should contain a
c time-hack and the two measured temperatures (degrees Kelvin) in free 
c format as:

c Year. Last 2 digits only
c Julian day
c Hour
c Minute
c Snow/ground interface temperature (degrees Kelvin)
c Surface temperature (degrees Kelvin)
c
c If this option is selected, THERE MUST BE MEASURED VALUES FOR EACH
c TIME-HACK, or the model will give the error message "MET data and 
c thermocouple are out of sync.".  If data is unavailable, input the
c dummy value 999, and the model will ignore the datapoint.
