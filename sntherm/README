SNTHERM89.rev4 upgrade. Further revisions made through November 20,1996.  
Note improvements to turbulent transfer routine (Item 6) and new print-out options  
(Item 7).

I am in the process of creating a Web-Site for the User's Guide to make it available
over the internet along with the computer code.  It should be completed by the end
of the year.

*******************************************************************************
This directory contains code for SNTHERM89.rev4, released on Nov 10, 1995. 
Questions about the code should be addressed to Ms. Rachel Jordan, USA-CRREL.
e-mail:rjordan@crrel.usace.army.mil.

A running list of changes made to the code since Nov 10, 1995 is recorded in the
file README.CHANGES. IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE USER TO CHECK THIS FTP SITE
FROM TIME TO TIME AND TO KEEP UP WITH THESE CHANGES. 

A. The major upgrades affecting this version are:

1) A variable albedo algorithm can be triggered by inputting a snow albedo 
greater than 1. The routine is an adaptation of that described in the 
dissertation of Danny Marks (1988), which in turn is based on the work of 
Marshall and Warren (1987). The main driver in the routine is grain size.  The 
routine does not handle dirty or shallow snow (<10cm) and is limited to clear 
sky conditions, but does make an adjustment for slope and solar angle. 
Complete documentation can be had from R. Jordan.

The following new options require additional input to LINE READ 1 of the 
LAYER.IN file. 

2) There are now three ways to specify the density of new snow, which was 
previously hard-wired to 100 kg/m3.  A lower limit is set to 30 kg/m3.

   a. A fixed density for new snow [bifallin] can be input.
   b. SNTHERM can estimate the new density based on air temperature, using 
the Alta function described in Anderson (1976) or in LaChapelle (1961). This 
option is triggered by inputting a density greater than 950. kg/m3.  There are 
of course variables other than temperature affecting the new snow density 
(wind speed, crystal type, etc.), so that estimates may be off by as much as 
50%
   c. If 0.0 is input, new snow densities will be read from the MET.IN file.  
The column for this parameter should be inserted after that for new grain size. 
Establishing these values is tricky, since density measurements need to be 
corrected for settlement during the storm. Adjustments are best made using eq 
(26) in Jordan (1991), with T as an average temperature.  By integrating (26) 
the average settlement is found as the rate times one-half the time elapsed 
since the beginning of snowfall.  As discussed in item 5), the settling phase  
of compaction is now limited to either 15% over the initial density or by the 
"dmlimit" cutoff. Back correction for settlement should consider these limits.  
The overburden contribution to compaction is small by comparison and can 
be neglected in the correction.

3) THE PRECIPITATION RATE IS NOW ENTERED IN THE MET FILE IN M/HR OF SNOW 
WATER EQUIVALENT UNITS, instead of in m/hr of as snow accumulation.  This 
change was necessary because of the variable new snow density, but also has 
has the benefit that swe can be taken directly from the precip gauge. 

4) The upper limit on snowfall is set at +2.5C.  This determination was based 
on data provided in Snow Hydrology (1956), p. 55.  The percentage of liquid 
water by mass in falling snow is arbitrarily set to vary linearly with air 
temperature from 0% at 0C to a 40% maximum at + 2C.

 5) Recent testing of the compaction algorithm, taken from Anderson (1976), 
indicated that adjustments were in order. The settling or destructive 
metamorphism component was found to significantly overpredict the 
compaction rate for new snow and the overburden component to compact the 
snow too slowly.  More study is needed of the compaction rate of new snow,
but as a 'Band-Aid' it is suggested that the upper snow density limit  
[dmlimit] for the settling process be lowered from the previously fixed value 
of 150 kg/m3 to around 100 kg/m3. Dmlimit is now entered in the LAYER.IN file, 
and the model takes as a cut-off the smaller of this value and the density of  
the snow at the start of the storm compacted by 15%.  Limited testing of the 
overburden function suggests a lower value of 0.9d6kg-s/m2 for the viscosity 
coefficient, slightly less than the value of 1.0d6kg-s/m2 used by Brun et al.
(1989). The viscosity coefficient [eta0] is now an input. In Jordan (1991), 
the units on eta0 were incorrectly stated as N-s/m2 and the units on 
overburden as N/m2 instead of kg/m2.  In accordance with Brun et al., I have 
also changed the exponential scaling factor on density in eq (29) from 0.021 
to 0.023 m3/kg.  The model had adjusted for mass losses due to melt by 
decreasing the thickness of nodes (rather than by decreasing snow density).  
In the heavier stages of melt this procedure contributed to over-densification 
of the pack, and with the exception of the top node has now been limited to 
snow less dense than 250 kg/m3. The compaction of wet snow and snow 
undergoing melt needs further study.  In the later stages of the melt period, 
after the snow has undergone several freeze-thaw cycles, the model over-
densifies the snowcover due to repeated freezing of the retained residual 
water.


6) Turbulent Transfer. SNTHERM was originally fit to measured data on cold snow, with 
the primary intent of predicting snow surface temperature.  The parameters in the 
User's Guide are a best fit for these purposes and conditions.  In addition, 
the stability correction for stable atmospheric conditions was turned off, as  
it appeared to degrade the model's ability to predict surface temperatures.  
Subsequent testing of the model under melt conditions, at CRREL and 
elsewhere, have indicated that these default parameters cause the model to
over-predict melt.  The current recommendation (as of November, 1996)
is to use the stability correction , but to set an upper limit on the Richardson
number. This is done through a new input switch [istboff], where the stability
correction is turned off when istboff = 1, is on when istboff = 0 and is on with 
a limit of Rb = 0.16 when istboff = 2.  The current hard-wired limit of 0.16 is 
conservative.  It could be set as low as 0.12 and still be realistic.

AS OF NOVEMBER 1996, QTURB AND QTURB2 ARE REPLACED WITH QTURB3.
The main addition to this routine is the correct computation of the transfer
functions when measurement heights for air temperature, wind speed and Rh are at
different levels.  To improve computation of the Richardson number, an estmation
of the new surface temperature is used rather than the past temperature.  The "iqturb" 
switch is no longer used, but is required as a "space holder."


7) Alternative output. CRREL added alternative output options as part of 
ongoing developments in distributed runs which may be of use to other SNTHERM 
users.  Specific shell scripts used at CRREL rely on different output formats
for both the standard output file ("snow.out") and the flux output file
("flux.out").  The ifluxout variable is now used as a generic output format
variable.  The values of ifluxout are the sum of the flux.out format code and
the snow.out format code.  The use of these format codes retains the original
values of ifluxout for the default output formats, but also allows for new
output formats to be developed and for any combination of output formats
to be used.

snow.out format codes used in ifluxout variable:

0	default (original) output format (write.f)
10	no snow output
20	alternative output format 2 (write2.f)
30	alternative output format 3 (write2.f)

flux.out format codes used in ifluxout variable:

0	no flux output
1	default (original) flux output format
2	alternative output format

All alternative snow.out formats differ from the original format as follows:

- no header information
- swe(mm), depth(m), outflux(kg/m2) and cold content (j/m2) are printed after a '|' on time line
- time line printed before snow profile (instead of after)

Alternative snow.out format 2 also differs as follows:

- only top soil layer printed
- time line only printed when snow profile is printed

The alternative flux.out format differs from the original format as follows:

- no header information
- eliminated met data after flux columns
- time changed to decimal-day format
- order of remaining columns changed

For some stock material types, many of the characteristics are automacally supplied from a 
database within the model as shown in Table 1. Codes for materials crrently catalogued in 
the model are:

1=snow 2=clay 3=sand (90..99)= user supplied material

-Fractional humidity relative to saturated state			(1.0 For snow, <1.0 for soil)

The remainder of this file is unchanged from the original User's Guide.


Following is an example of the revised LINE READ 1 of the LAYER.IN file.

2,6,1,990.,0,0,0,0,400.,0,0,3600.,0,1.78,0.04,999.,100.,2,2,0.9d6,ln,pinv,
ifluxout,bp,isolarcalc,ircalc,islope,itracks,bext,itm,ioutfiltrate,dtbase, 
imetcalc,albsnow,ssisnow,bifallin,dmlimit,istboff,iqturb,eta0

Variable computation of albedo is indicated by albsnow = 1.78 (> 1.0).
Computation of the new snow density is triggered by bifall = 999. (> 950.).
The settling compaction limit dmlimit is 100 kg/m3.
The stability correction for stable conditions has a minimum lower limit 
The viscosity coefficient is 0.9d6 kg-s/m2.

B. Other changes to the code.

The upper limit on the grain growth algorithm has been increased from 3mm 
to 5mm, and the lower limit on the algorithm for estimating the grain size of 
new snow has been decreased from 400 microns to 25 microns.  Since grain 
size is critical when computing albedo, it is recommended that both the new 
snow density and grain size be estimated if the variable albedo option is 
selected and the data set contains multiple snow events. The new snow grain 
size algorithm is triggered by stating the grain size as 0.0 in the MET.IN file. 
Debugging changes have been made in the procedures for handling wet snow 
storms. 

The routine for generating the SNOW.OUT file has been expanded to 
print out information on the new options, plus it echoes other input 
information not printed out before.

There have been minor debugging changes to the code, some of which 
corrected problems experienced by very strict compilers.


C. Changes to the User's Guide. 

In addition to the three new parameters in LINE.READ 1 of the LAYER.IN 
file and the different default values for melting snow, there are the following 
changes.

The terminology of 'Turbulent Schmidt number' and 'Turbulent 
Prandtl number' is incorrect. More accurate descriptions are respectively:
'ratio of neutral stability bulk turbulent transfer coefficients of momentum 
and latent heat (Cd/Ce)' and 'ratio of neutral stability turbulent transfer 
coefficients of momentum and sensible heat (Cd/Ch).' 

THE PRECIPITATION RATE IS NOW ENTERED IN THE MET FILE IN 
M/HR OF SNOW WATER EQUIVALENT UNITS, instead of in m/hr of 
snow accumulation

If 0.0 is input for bifallin, new snow densities will be read from the MET.IN 
file. The column for this parameter should be inserted after that for new grain 
size.  If bifallin is <0.0, the new snow density will be read from the met file
but overridden.

Cloud type 5 in the MET.IN file is disallowed.
